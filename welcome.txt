You are standing in front of a large white house.
Next to you is a small mailbox. It is an old fashioned mailbox,
the kind that you might see standing next to a farmhouse out in
the country somewhere. The only thing is, this is the city. The
mailbox just doesn't belong here. Oh, and it is purple! Yes, it
is purple and it has white flowers on it.

Your car is parked at the curb. Unfortunately, in your haste to
get out of the car, you locked your keys and your phone inside.
Good luck with that.
