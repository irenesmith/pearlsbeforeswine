You recently received a letter from an attorney, telling you that your long
lost Aunt Hedwig has passed away, leaving you all of her possessions. Although
you didn't realize that you had an Aunt Hedwig, you have come to Carpenter's
Point, eager to take possession of your inheritance. Times have been rather
tough lately. You were let go from your job, your parents really don't want
you hanging around their house anymore, but you can't afford to move out.
That is, until now.

Apparently, good old Aunt Hedwig had a nice house in Carpenter's Point and
enough money for you to live there without having to worry about how you are
going to pay for things. After stopping at the lawyer's office, you have
arrived at your aunt's house. It is on a quiet dead-end street in a slightly
run-down part of town. The house itself is in good repair but the lawn needs
cutting and other general chores have obviously been neglected as well.
